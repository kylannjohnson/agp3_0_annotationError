/**
 * This is a copy of the AutoValue annotation in the auto-value library.
 *
 * Since we're specifying the auto-value library as an "apt" dependency (annotation processor), we can't reference any classes in the library from
 * our application code -- we can only reference the code that it generates. As a result, the AutoValue annotation (the one that this is copied
 * from) isn't visible to application code, and the app won't compile. By including the AutoValue annotation separately in the project, we can
 * still use the AutoValue annotation as intended while keeping the auto-value annotation processor as an "apt" dependency (so long as the package
 * name of the AutoValue annotation is the same -- com.google.auto.value). Apparently in auto-value version 1.2, the AutoValue annotation will be
 * a separate dependency and we won't need this workaround. See the issue here: https://github.com/google/auto/issues/268.
